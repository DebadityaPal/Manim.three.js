# Standard Animation Engine to be Used

A basic animation has been created using threejs.
- Run `npm i` to install all the required packages.
- Install `http-server` module to run a server.
    - Run `npm i http-server -g` to globally install it
    - Run `http-server . -p <port-number>` alongwith the port number to run the server in that port.
    - Default port is `8080`
- Open [localhost at port 8080](127.0.0.1:8080/) to run the animation.
